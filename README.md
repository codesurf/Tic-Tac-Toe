# Tic-Tac-Toe
Traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game which is developed using Minimax Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence where computer is playing using this algorithm and the other player is either a common user or a random move player.
1. Computer-vs-User -> User is a common player who can interact with the game and can play any desired but valid moves and computer will be playing against it.
2. Computer-vs-Random -> Random is a random move generator and there is no interaction in this version. Random move generator makes random moves and corresponding to each move, Computer plays a counter move.
